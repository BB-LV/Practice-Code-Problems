/*
You Can't Code Under Pressure #1 8kyu

Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.


This is a simple kata giving us a single integer as input and asking us to return an integer,
as fast as we can. I spent more time creating the file and setting up the document than I 
did returning the function. 

We can return our input multiplied by 2 to solve this kata.

// function doubleInteger(i) {
//   return i * 2;
// }

const doubleInteger = i => i*2
